Perfect — here’s a complete, professional **5-second first-person video scenario** in English for your concept:

---

### **Video Title:**

**“Fading Vision – First-Person Morning Scene”**

### **Duration:**

5 seconds

### **Style:**

Realistic, cinematic — first-person perspective of a man waking up in an Iranian-style bedroom.

---

### **Scene Breakdown:**

**Second 0-1:**
The video begins with a first-person view of a man lying in bed.
Soft morning light filters through a semi-transparent curtain.
The viewer can see part of a wooden headboard, patterned Persian bedsheets, and the faint sound of morning birds outside.

**Second 1-2:**
The camera slowly tilts upward, as if the man is pushing himself up from bed.
You can hear the subtle rustle of fabric and a quiet breath — everything feels peaceful and real.

**Second 2-3:**
As the man sits upright, the edges of the frame begin to darken slightly — tunnel vision begins.
The brightness of the room fades a little, and a low humming sound enters, resembling mild ear ringing or pressure.

**Second 3-4:**
The tunnel vision intensifies — the center of the frame flickers and starts to blur.
All ambient sounds (birds, breathing, fabric noise) fade rapidly, replaced by muffled silence.

**Second 4-5:**
Complete blackness fills the screen.
The silence deepens for half a second, simulating total blackout.
Then — a faint return of distant ambient sound (suggesting recovery) just before the video ends.

### **Sound Design Notes:**

* Start with natural morning ambience: birds, light room echo, breathing.
* Gradually add a low-frequency hum (around 40–60 Hz) as vision fades.
* Fade to near-total silence at blackout.

Would you like me to expand this into a **production-ready script** with camera directions, sound levels, and visual cues (so a videographer or editor can recreate it exactly)?
